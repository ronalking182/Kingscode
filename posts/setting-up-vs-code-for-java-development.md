How to develop and run a Hello World program in Java using Visual Studio Code is explained in this lesson.

To quickly start I would suggest you get vsCode installed through  this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) if you 
donâ€™t already have it.

&nbsp;

## Coding Pack for JAVA

Instead of installing Vscode from scratch, you can use the Coding Pack for Java, which includes VS Code, JDK, and other necessary Java extensions.

-for mac:[mac](https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-mac)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Note**: The Coding Pack for Java is only available for Windows and macOS. For other operating systems, you will need to manually install a JDK, VS Code, and Java extensions.
