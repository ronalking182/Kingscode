Solving real-world problems and participating in real-world initiatives are the best ways to learn how to code. Despite the value of academic information, without the capacity to apply it, you have little chance of improving.
I spent a long time investigating and filtering through the huge universe of the internet to compile this list of the top ten sites for practicing front-end skills. By using these websites, you will reinforce everything you've learned in lessons and become a more capable front-end developer. So, let's get this party started.

Tree house provides programs for as little as $25 per month, allowing you to master languages like JavaScript or even programming languages like PHP. They also offer tracks with a specialized curriculum so you may learn something specific in addition to their in-demand courses.

When it comes to interview preparation, practice makes perfect. Front-end developers frequently struggle to find suitable interviewing resources. Ace Front End was founded to address this issue. You'll be given entire coding challenges as well as a thorough explanation of how to construct a successful interview solution with Ace Front End. You can use our platform even if you are not preparing for an interview.

The Front End Mentor gives you a realistic workflow to practice your front-end skills. To get you started, they've included mobile and desktop designs, materials, and a style guide. This platform is recommended not just for novices, but also for learners who are always learning new things. You'll use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks (like React, Vue.js, and others) as well as APIs. New tasks are added to the platform on a regular basis, so you can always find something to do, post your solution, and get feedback.

Unlike CSS battles, this site allows you to test yourself in a variety of languages. This platform focuses on code difficulties rather than visual problems. This platform can be used to hone and improve your skills in the construction of a project. It's an excellent place to hone your problem-solving abilities. Code wars is a great place to practice JavaScript if you're a front-end developer.


## 5.****Codewell****

Real-world Figma templates are available from Code well to help you enhance your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It's also possible to contribute a solution through the website or their developing Slack community. If you have a free account, you won't be able to see the Figma file, but you might be able to see the project assets, so you can still use this platform.


## 6.****CSS Battles****

While this one is specialized to CSS, the gamification system is a wonderful method to keep learning, and there are prizes to be won at the end of several battles.
While the battles there will not teach you how to design web layouts, they will undoubtedly assist you in mastering some of the more advanced CSS attributes.


## 7.****Frontloop****
