If you want to advance professionally as a developer and/or software engineer this year, you should focus on these eight areas.

### Be Disciplined

An untrained developer will not be able to deliver on time and will not write maintainable code. A disciplined developer will not only help a project succeed, but will also increase the productivity of others. When software architects and developers attribute their success to the approach they use, they are doing themselves a disservice. It all comes down to your level of discipline. Without discipline, things like tools and languages are irrelevant, lean how to properly organize your work and be precise in everything you do 

### Be Open To New Things

As a developer, we work in an area where change is never stagnant but always dynamic. Changes in the realm of programming frequently come when we least anticipate them, whether it's a new framework or a new programming syntax. It's safe to assume that as a developer or programmer, we should expect change. Change can be frightening, but it is beneficial not just to you as an individual, but also to your entire career and its prospective future.

### Write Clean And Re-useable Code

Learn to reuse and care for your code to save time in the future and establish yourself as a trustworthy resource for your clients. Other developers will be able to grasp your code more easily if it is written in a clean manner.

### Never Stop Learning

Don't take what you know for granted, technology will start to move behind your back. Stay alert and keep up with change, read more, dive deep into new topic. In other was, don't be proud as a developer, no one can be an island of knowledge

### Be A Persistent Problem Solver

Don't give up easy; remember that when you're slowed down by an issue, it's simply a stepping stone on the way to where you need to go; the solution could be right around the corner.Programing is more of problem solving then actual coding donâ€™t forget 

### Listen More Than Your Speak

Being a good listener should come first; ensure that you take the time to analyze everything that is said to you and that you do not leap to conclusions too quickly.

### Know How To Get Help Online

Make a list of resources you find useful so you can refer to them when you need assistance, and learn how to turn your problem into searchable terms.

### Deeply Focus On The Right Things

Try not to get distracted and learn how to prioritize your work. Set clear goals for your current duties and break them down into phases that are easy to follow.
