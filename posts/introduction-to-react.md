# **What is React?**

React is a javascript  visual interface development library that seeks to make the building of visual interfaces easier.

&nbsp;

When Facebook introduced it to the public in 2013, it powered some of the most popular apps, including Facebook and Instagram.


&nbsp;

Breaking down an interface into components is its major purpose, making it easier to understand the interface and its state at any moment.

&nbsp;

# **Why is React so popular?**

The frontend web development world has been rocked by React. Why?

&nbsp;

# Less complicated than the other options

For developers, React JS makes front-end programming easier than ever before. In addition to allowing developers to declaratively design user interfaces, it also makes coding easier to read and understand by removing a lot of the heavy lifting from the process.

&nbsp;

# **Is React simple to learn?**

Even though I previously stated that React is easier to learn than other frameworks, getting started with React is still difficult. This is due to the fact that additional technologies, such as Redux and GraphQL, can be utilized with React.

&nbsp;

React has a very simple API, and to get started, you only need to comprehend four ideas:

 -[Components](https://www.kingscod.com/blog/component-in-react)

-[JSX](https://www.kingscod.com/blog/jsx-in-react)

-State (coming soon)

-[Props](https://www.kingscod.com/blog/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react)
