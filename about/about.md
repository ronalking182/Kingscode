# Hi there! I &rsquo;m KingDavid Abutanko.

&nbsp;


 I &rsquo;m a computer science student with a diverse set of software and web development skills. Web programming is a hobby of mine that I can never get enough of. When I was learning to program, I despised programming the first time I attempted it. I felt as if I'd never be able to understand what is needed to be a true coder. I was starting to feel like a phony. Because of how and where I learned to program, there is always another vocabulary to learn, another framework to master, and another issue to find and fix. Fortunately, I was able to figure out two things:

&nbsp;

 1.It &rsquo;s enjoyable for me to write about a subject I &rsquo; m interested in.

2.I find that writing helps me to organize my thoughts.
&nbsp;

I tried to write a short essay to describe what I had learnt whenever I discovered something new. Even a single paragraph can assist you develop a deeper understanding of what you &rsquo;ve learnt.
That is why this blog exists. It isn &rsquo;t simply for the benefit of others; it has benefited me as well.
&nbsp;

From reddit to stackoverflow, I &rsquo;m grateful to the large community of programmers who create articles and tutorial videos for their assistance and advise in honing my skills and abilities as a web developer. This website is an attempt on my part to give back to the global programming community. I publish informative information on this blog to help readers improve their lives.
 &nbsp;

 My desire to teach and assist others in becoming better motivated me to write about my experience as a developer. I &rsquo;m delighted it &rsquo;s found a home on this site. I hope you find my content interesting and informative.
